# TTRPG Music Player

The idea of this music player is to allow you to set any background noise you want + any song at the same time so you can have a fighting boss song on a forest at night.

It will allow multiple background noises at once so you can have, for example, heavy machinery sounds, random falling pipe sounds and footsteps so you can create any enviroment you like to fit your narrative.

## GOALS

- Have a drag and drop feature for .mp3, .ogg and .wav files + a prompt to ask for a category and name changing (not the file, just the title on the program).
- Simple UI.
- Have "sets" of songs saved into playlists. You could save a set of songs titled "common places" and have beach.mp3, city.mp3 and forest.mp3, create a new playlist and add that set automatically to it.
- Mock pop-up window so you can stream that on discord for screensharing the audio without spoiling the songs' titles.
- Have that mock pop-up support drag and drop .bpm, .png, .jpg, and other common formats to make it so you can display art, characters, or designs.
- Select multiple background noises and be able to play them all at once.

## What I don't know how to do
- Support drag and drop youtube links
